Terse
=====
Interpreter for the esoteric "Terse" programming 

The Terse interpreter comes in two different versions: open source and closed source. Both versions are free. To begin writing Terse programs, follow these steps:

1. Choose which interpreter you want to use
    The open source interpreter allows you to modify the language and contribute features, but it requires Python2.7 in 
    order to run. It is slightly slower than the closed source version. It can be used on any platform (Windows, Linux,       and MacOS)
    
    The closed source interpreter does not allow for any modifications, and comes in the form of a Windows .exe executable
    file. Although it runs faster than the open source, there are currently no versions for any OS other than Windows.
    
2. Download the relevant files for the interpreter that you chose and unzip them into a convenient directory.
